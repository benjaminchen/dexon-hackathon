Only weeks ago, sinking into the Sleep was fun. The VirtNet combined the most cutting-edge technology and the most sophisticated gaming for a full mind-body experience. And it was Michael’s passion. But now every time Michael sinks, he risks his life.</p><p>The Mortality Doctrine—Kaine’s master plan—has nearly been realized, and little by little the line separating the virtual from the real is blurring. If Kaine succeeds, it will mean worldwide cyber domination. And it looks like Michael and his friends are the only ones who can put the monster back in the box—if Michael can figure out who his friends really are.</p></div><form action=""><input type="text" placeholder="$"/><button class="next-btn" type="submit"><span>Buy</span><i></i></button></form></div></div></div></div><div class="right"><div class="book-bg"><a class="logo" href="index.html"><img src="../assets/images/logo.png"/></a><div class="tab-pane" id="discuss"><ol><li>Dashner takes full advantage of the Matrix-esque potential for asking ‘what is real.</li><li>Set in a world taken over by virtual reality gaming, the series perfectly capture[s] Dashner’s hallmarks for inventiveness, teen dialogue and an ability to add twists and turns like no other author.</li><li>A brilliant, visceral, gamified mash-up of The Matrix and Inception, guaranteed to thrill even the non-gaming crowd.</li><li>An exhilarating adventure story with touches of Anthony Horowitz’s Alex Rider books and Orson Scott Card’s Ender’s Game.</li><li>Dashner's descriptions are screenplay-ready. . . .
